# PuzzleFighterTraining
Package to help puzzle fighter players practice chains and other stuff with the Arcade ROM of puzzle fighter
place both the `run_spf2t_training.bat` and `puzzlefighter` folder in `/Fightcade/emulator/fbneo` folder (try to make sure there are no spaces in your filepath)

Run `run_spf2t_training.bat` to fire up training mode. It should work with either arcade or 2p about the same.

## Hotkeys
Lua hotkeys for special actions atm (bind them using FBNeo input options)

`Start`   : Open up the menu

`Hotkey 1`: Send queue'd Gems to both players

`Hotkey 2`: Get a free diamond

`Hotkey 3`: Change bottom gem of current piece. hold up to change top piece

`Hotkey 4`: Clear P1's board

`Hotkey 5`: Minus 5 garbage from P2 queue

`Hotkey 6`: Minus 5 garbage from P1 queue



Set P2 garbage queue to 0 and send to reset damage so you can check how much you're doing on separate combos/attacks 

Margin time can be adjusted in the training menu
